# Blockpool Node Installation

An easy to use bash script for managing a Blockpool Node

## WARNING: BPL-node requires en_US.UTF-8 to be the system default LOCALE. See [here](../Troubleshooting/LOCALE.md) for more information before starting the install.

## Method 1 via BPL-commander

### DO NOT RUN BPL COMMANDER AS ROOT 

#### Create a user

1. Use the `adduser` command to add a new user to your system. Be sure to replace username with the user that you want to create.

	`sudo adduser username`


2. Set and confirm the new user's password at the prompt. A strong password is highly recommended!


3. Follow the prompts to set the new user's information. It is fine to accept the defaults to leave all of this information blank.


4. Use the usermod command to add the user to the sudo group.

	`sudo usermod -aG sudo username`
	
	Again replacing username with the name used in step #1


5. Switch to the new user

	`su - username`

#### Get BPL-Commander

##### Via Git:

1. Clone the repo

	`git clone https://github.com/blockpool-io/BPL-Commander.git`

2. Move to the folder

	`cd BPL-Commander`

3. Make the script executable

	`chmod +x BPLcommander.sh`

4. Start BPLcommander

	`./BPLcommander.sh`

5. Jump to (Using BPL-Commander)[/BPL-Node.md#using-bpl-commander]

##### Via wget

1. Get the script

	`wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/blockpool-io/BPL-Commander/master/BPLcommander.sh `

#### Using BPL-Commander

- BPL commander will ask for your sudo password. This is needed to update your package sources. If you are hosting on a service that uses a private key, no action will be needed.
