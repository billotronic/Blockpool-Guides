# Setting up a Blockpool Delegate

## Requirements
- A Blockpool wallet ([Guide](../Installation/BPL-Desktop.md)). For the sake of this guide we are going to use the Blockpool-Desktop client. Take note of your passphrase as this will be needed for the node configuration.
**_It is STRONGLY recommended to create a second passphrase ([Guide](./2ndpassphrase.md)) if you are running a node._**

- 11 BPL to register and vote for your delgate + BPL to stake. 

- Reliable Hardware and internet conncetion. This is crucial to not only maximize returns on your BPL that is forging, but also to secure the Blockpool network.
There are two approaches to this. You can either host the node on your own PC or host on a Virtual Private Server (VPS) / dedicated server. Overall system minimal requirements
are 1 core and 4 GB RAM but see Node Considerations for further information on requirements

- Linux. This has been tested with Ubuntu v16.0.4 and these instructions will be for that flavor of linux

- BPL-node ([Guide](../Installation/BPL-Node.md)) installed and synced with the network
