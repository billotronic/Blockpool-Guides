### Setting the proper locale

BPL-node only supports the en_US.UTF-8 locale. To install this locale on a ubuntu/debian OS enter these commands into the console:

```sudo dpkg-reconfigure locales```

Use the DOWNARROW to navigate to en_US.UTF-8 UTF-8 and select it by pressing SPACEBAR. Press TAB to get to OK and hit ENTER

Select en_US.UTF-8 as the system default and select OK
